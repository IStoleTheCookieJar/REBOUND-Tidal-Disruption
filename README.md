# REBOUND-Tidal-Disruption
A python module that contains useful REBOUND simulation generation functions, and more importantly a collision handler emulating the physics of a Tidal Disruption Event.

All useful functions can be found in the Functions.py file, this file can be easily transfered to any local project directories for use

An example of how to use the functions in Functions.py is provided in the Testing_Ground.ipynb

Simulat.py is designed for running REBOUND simulations through the terminal with changeable inputs. Useful for supercomputer job submissions. Computationally intensive. Input usage description is provided in the Simulat.py file.
